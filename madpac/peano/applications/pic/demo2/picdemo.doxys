 This is the documentation of the PDE component picdemo. It is 
 generated by the Peano Prototyping (PeProt) tool and is just a blueprint. 
 
 !!! Algorithmic steps
 
 The component algorithm consists of the following steps:
 
|| Adapter name | Semantics 
| SetupExperiment | t.b.d.
| SetupExperimentAndPlot | t.b.d.

 
 
 !!! Data structures
 
 The solver is based on the following DaStGen models:

 !! Cell 
 
 \code
   \include dastgen/Cell.def
 \endcode
 
 !! State 
 
 \code
   \include dastgen/State.def
 \endcode

 !! Vertex 
 
 \code
   \include dastgen/Vertex.def
 \endcode
