 @dir "puregrid"

 The puregrid application is, besides some logging and parallelisation 
 configuration tags, a component as-is, i.e. as it is created by RaPeP.
 It just creates one adaptive grid for a (hyper-)sphere, and, thus, might 
 be a perfect starting point to get familiar with Peano from a computer 
 science point of view. However, let me point out that the poisson component 
 provides a worked-out tutorial on Peano.
