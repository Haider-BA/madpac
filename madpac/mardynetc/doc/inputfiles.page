/*! \page "Mardyn Input Files"

@TODO write or complete the page...

Basically, there seem to be 2 kinds of input files: 
- a configuration file which contains determines technical stuff like io, 
  things related to parallelization and so on
- a phase space specification file, which contains application specific thing 
  like the specification of the molecule types being simulated and the positions
  of the indivudual molecules.


!!! Config file

@TODO Sketch general.

!! timestepLength 
!! cutoffRadius
!! phaseSpaceFile 

! OldStyle 
Specifies a phase space specifiation file of the old input file (whatever the "old" input style is!?).

! 1CLJGen

<b>Note This particle generator doesn't produce input which is physically correct
      in any way. It's intended to be used just to test technical stuff!</b>

Generates 1-Center-Lennard-Jones molecules as input. There are two 
modes, "Homogeneous" or "Cluster". Independent of the mode, the generator needs 
two more parameters, the number of molecules and the temperature.

In any case, the size of the simulation box is calculated automatically.

- "Homogeneous"
Creates a homogeneous distribution of a gas. The molecules are distributet randomly
within the domain. The generator takes one more parameter, the density of the gas.

A line could look like
\verbatim
#                      mode        N     T  rho
phaseSpaceFile 1CLJGen Homogeneous 20000 10 0.08
\endverbatim

- "Cluster"
Create a inhomogeneous distribution, i.e. a scenario where molecules are clustered
as drops in a gas phase. Apart from N and T, the generator takes the following 
additional parameters:
	- the density of the gas
	- the density of the fluid (i.e. in the drops)
	- the percentage of volume covered by the drops (in percent)
	- the volume of the largest drops (in percent of the total volume)
	- the number of sphere-classes. The drops of a class have a radius 0.9 * radius
	  of the drops of the larger class.

A line could look like
\verbatim
#                      mode    N     T   rho_gas  rho_fluid  fluidVolume  maxSphereVolume  numSphereSizes
phaseSpaceFile 1CLJGen Cluster 2000  10  0.1      0.4        10           30               5   4
\endverbatim

!! parallelization DomainDecomposition
!! datastructure LinkedCells
!! cellsInCutoffRadius

!! Output Writer

- VTKWriter: For the specification of the VTKWriter to visualize the output with Paraview, see "Visualisation with Paraview"
- StatisticsWriter:
Add the line 
\verbatim
output StatisticsWriter n filename
\endverbatim
to the config file. See "StatisticsWriter".

!!! Component Specification

!!! Phase Specification File

The phase specification file consists of two parts: 
- a header containing information about the parameters of the simulation, e.g. 
  size of the simulation box, the specification of the molecule types, and so on.
- the body, containing information about the individual molecules, i.e. their 
  positions, velocities, type, ...
  
!! Header

An example header looks like:

\verbatim
MDProject trunk 20090731
currentTime     0
Temperature     0.7
Length  97.     97.     97.
NumberOfComponents      1
1 0 0 0 0
0. 0. 0.       10000.  1. 1. 5.0 0.0
0. 0. 0.
1.0e+10

\endverbatim

- MDProject trunk xxx: denotes the version of Mardyn for which this file actually 
  was written. I guess this entry causes more troubles than it helps and actually
  one should think about an extensible, backwards-compatible file format.
  
- currentTime: the time of the simulation (i guess that's only important if the
  phase space is written at the end of an simulation)
  
- Temperature: the (current? / target ? / initial ? ) temperature ???

- Length: the size of the simulation box

- NumberOfComponents: the number of different molecule types which are described
  in the header. For each component there is a line with 5 integer values denoting
  the number of centers for
  \verbatim
  #lennard-jones   #charge   #dipole   #quadrupole   #tersoff
  \endverbatim
  
  for each of the centers there has to be a line of integers describing the center
  (e.g. if the line with 5 integers looks like "2 0 1 0 0" there have to be two 
  lines describing the lennard-jones centers and one line describing the dipole).
  
  Following the values for the centers there have to be three double values which
  probably should be just set to 0.0.
  
  For several components there need to be 
  
  1.0e10 is some value.
  
! Lennard-Jones 
is described by 8 values:
\verbatim
x-   y-   z-coordinates   mass   epsilon   sigma   cutoff   doshift
\endverbatim

! Charge

! Dipole

! Quadrupole

! Tersoff
  
!! Body
